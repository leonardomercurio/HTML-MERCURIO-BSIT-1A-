        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            My name is Leonardo III D. Mercurio, a BSIT–1A student at Sultan Kudarat State University – Isulan Campus.
            I was born on December 03, 2004, in Tacurong City and grew up and live almost half my life in Kidapawan City.

            I want to enjoy this program while developing skills that will help me build a stable,
            successful future with peace of mind—not only for myself, but also for my family and others I may help along the way.
